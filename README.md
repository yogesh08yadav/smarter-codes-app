# Chat App

## Package for features
. To show the exact time like seconds ago I have used moment js library. 

. For routing through the app I have used react-router-dom.

## Functionality
. Click on new chat and enter the name to chat with. Press enter to add the member.

. All the members will be added in chat in the way that the last created will appear on the top.

. Now click on the person to chat with and we can type the message and press enter.

. The latest message will be shown on chat window.

. There a star option will appear beside every message. Click on the star to add that message to starred message.

. Once a message is starred it cannot be added again in the starred message. To add again it first have to be destarred from starred message.

. To view starred message click on starred message and there the message will be shown.

. An option to unstar the message will also appear beside every message.

## Assumptions 

. It was getting complex for me to show options while hovering on messages. I was using mouse events but while using them all the messages were getting effected, so it was creating a bug.

. I knew how that funcitionality can be implemented so I have put a static star to show the same functionality.

. The app could have been more optimised with basic changes like adding one more component we can reduce the code. This hover problem can also be solved but due to my health issue I can't focus much.
